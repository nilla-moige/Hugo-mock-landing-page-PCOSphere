Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder that affects individuals with ovaries, typically during their reproductive years. PCOS can cause a wide range of symptoms and is one of the leading causes of infertility.

## **Common Symptoms**

PCOS symptoms can vary from person to person but may include:

- Irregular or missed menstrual periods
- Excess hair growth (hirsutism), often on the face or body
- Acne and oily skin
- Weight gain or difficulty losing weight
- Thinning hair or hair loss
- Darkened patches of skin, often around the neck or underarms

## **Causes of PCOS**

The exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but factors that may contribute include:

1. **Hormonal Imbalances:** Elevated levels of androgens (male hormones) can interfere with ovulation and cause physical symptoms.
2. **Insulin Resistance:** Many individuals with PCOS have insulin resistance, which can lead to weight gain and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
3. **Genetics:** PCOS often runs in families, suggesting a genetic link.

## **Diagnosis**

Doctors typically diagnose PCOS based on a combination of:

- Medical history
- Physical examination
- Blood tests to check hormone levels
- Pelvic ultrasound to examine the ovaries

## **Treatment Options**

While there is no cure for PCOS, there are several ways to manage symptoms:

### 1. **Lifestyle Changes**

- **Diet:** A balanced diet rich in whole foods can help manage weight and insulin levels.
- **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve insulin resistance and overall well-being.

### 2. **Medications**

- **Hormonal Birth Control:** Helps regulate periods and reduce androgen levels.
- **Metformin:** Used to manage insulin resistance.
- **Fertility Medications:** For those trying to conceive.

### 3. **Hair and Skin Treatments**
